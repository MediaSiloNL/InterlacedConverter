Small little program to converts any video content to 1080 50i MPEG4 files

I wrote this small little program because we ran into a lot of issues with EVS's and progressive footage.
Most of our EVS's run in 1080 50i and the Xfile software won't convert the footage customers provided.
This tool will convert any input file to an 1080 50i 16Mbit MPEG4 file.

I know MPEG4 compression is not the best but if the footage was NTSC for example in the first place, that 16Mbit compression should be the least of your problems.

## Minimal Requirements
- Windows 7

### Future Options
- Vertical pull-down for DJI Drone footage
- Transcoding presets
- Progress Bar
- Full NTSC-PAL conversion
